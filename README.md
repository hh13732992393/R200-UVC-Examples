# R200-UVC-Examples
Intel Realsense R200 Examples for UVC on the NVIDIA Jetson Development Kits

These are modified Qt Creator examples for the Intel Realsense cameras using a UVC backend instead of
the default v4l2 backend. 

In addition, an extra example has been added (called 'atest') specifically
for the Jetson Dev Kits. This addition adds work arounds for some USB issues on the Jetsons.

The extra work around code is available from:
